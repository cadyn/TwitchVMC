# TwitchVMC
A VMC client with twitch integrations

## License
The project itself is licensed under GNU Affero General Public License Version 3, which can be found in full in LICENSE-AGPL3.txt.

This project also relies on other works and libraries which contain their own licenses, full details are in LICENSE, as well is in assets/3rdpartylicense, and often in the respective folders and scripts themselves.

Do not attempt to modify and distribute or use this code in a closed source manner, I will pursue litigation.

## Details
This was created because currently the only program that offers VMC services with twitch integrations is closed source and considerably lacking. In an effort to help out my local bee, I wanted to develop this.

## Usage
Usage is fairly simple at the moment. More details will be added as they come.
Use escape to access settings from the main app window. An additional settings window may be added in the future.
Load your model into VirtualMotionCapture, and tick the box to send it over your local network on the default port. Soon after your model should show up in TwitchVMC.
To connect with twitch, go to the twitch menu from the main menu, and click authenticate, then sign into your twitch account and authorize the app.

## Planned features:
Soon:
1. Customizable Twitch Integrations System,, with hopefully usable UI.
2. System for loading models from a config file, or just from a folder?
3. Object launcher for Twitch Integrations, customizable force and size.
4. Edible food for Twitch Integrations, customizable size
5. Custom animations for Twitch Integrations, ???

Long term:
1. Built in tracking options 
2. More support for custom models, probably outside of the VRM format. Maybe something similar to VRChat's avatar system?

Maybe(Haven't decided yet. Open to feedback on these.):
1. Second settings window

## Contributing
I will happily accept any bug reports, feature requests, pull requests, or any other contributions as long as they meet my standards for this program. These will likely be outlined more thoroughly in the future, but for now are just subject to my review.
