This project also relies on other works and libraries which contain their own licenses, full details are in LICENSE, as well is in assets/3rdpartylicense, and often in the respective folders and scripts themselves.

Do not attempt to modify and distribute or use this code in a closed source manner, I will pursue litigation.

# Details
This was created because currently the only program that offers VMC services with twitch integrations is closed source and considerably lacking. In an effort to help out my local bee, I wanted to develop this.


# Donations

Donations are not currently being accepted. I will accept them in the future once this project is worth half a dime, and on the basis that I am still the majority contributor.
